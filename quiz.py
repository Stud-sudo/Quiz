QUIZ APPLICATION


Core Functional Requirements:


our program must demonstrate the following functionality:
1. Data Storage: Use appropriate data structures (e.g., lists, tuples, dictionaries) to store at
least 5 quiz questions. Each question must include:
o The question text.
o Multiple-choice options (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4).
o The correct answer.
2. Quiz Execution: The program must:
o Iterate through each question one at a time.

o Print the question and the multiple-choice options to the console.
o Prompt the user to input their answer (e.g., by typing '1', '2', '3', or '4').
3. Scoring Logic: The program must:
o Check if the user's answer matches the correct answer.
o Keep a running total of the user's score.
4. Results Display: After the final question, the program must:
o Print the user's final score (e.g., "You scored 3 out of 5").
o Display a closing message.


Non-Functional & Development Requirements:
• Code Quality: Code must be clean, readable, and well-commented. It must follow Python
naming conventions and PEP 8 style guide where appropriate (e.g., meaningful variable
names, use of whitespace).
• Modular Design: Code must be written in a modular fashion. This means separating logic
into functions (e.g., a run_quiz() function, a check_answer() function) rather than writing
all code in a single block.
• Version Control: You must use Git for version control. Your entire development history
must be visible in your GitHub repository, with frequent commits over the development
period showing your progress.
• Testing: You must rigorously test your program to ensure it is robust and functions
correctly
